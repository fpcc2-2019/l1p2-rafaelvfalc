What is our daily overall clickthrough rate? How does it vary between the groups?

```{r}
buscas %>%
    group_by(date = substr(session_start_date, 1, 10), group) %>%
    summarise(click_mean = mean(num_clicks)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = click_mean, color = group)) +
    geom_point() + 
    facet_grid(~group) +
    labs(y = "Click Mean", x = "") +
    labs(title = "Daily Overall Rate") + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, angle = 45), legend.position="none")

What is our daily overall zero results rate? How does it vary between the groups?

```{r}

    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = count_zero/total , color = group)) +
